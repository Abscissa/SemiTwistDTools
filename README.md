SemiTwist D Tools
=================

Misc collection of tools, such as a case-insensitive string type, enhanced unittest features, a build configuration tool (stbuild, a cmd-line front-end for rdmd), useful mixins, etc.

SemiTwist D Tools works on Windows and Linux. SemiTwist D Tools attempts to work on all platforms, but as I don't currently have easy access to OSX/BSD/etc., some things may be broken and need to be fixed. Help with any such OS would be appreciated.

Guaranteed compatible with Goldie v0.9:

```bash
$ git clone https://bitbucket.org/Abscissa/semitwistdtools.git SemiTwistDTools
$ cd SemiTwistDTools
$ git checkout goldie-v0.9
```

Keep in mind this is not a real official release, a lot may be bitrotted and needs cleaned/stripped, there's a lot that will change, and there's no documentation yet.

Why the name 'SemiTwist'?
-------------------------

SemiTwist is the name of a small software company I've never had a chance to actually get off the ground. (If I do ever get to it, SemiTwist D Tools will still remain zlib/libpng license.)
